# OECD_insights
This is for EPA1315.

### Authors
* Get from other project we did.

## Executive Summary

## Problem Understanding
_What is the problem? Who is the client? (This might be provided)_ - Mees already wrote an introduction.

The client has asked us to look into ...

[Need 'compelling' visualization]

1. Show age dependency trends
2. Links to articles to show that OECD/governments have indeed identified this as a problem
3. What are stress criteria?

#### *Research Question*: Will increasing the age-dependency ratio increase the stress on a society?

### Methodology(?)
 _the human capital sustainability of a society_, which is based on the following specific indicators:
* One
* Two
* Three
...

## Data Understanding

_Use tables in the sections below to introduce and discuss each of the criteria + age dependency we are examining._

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

### Collection

### Description

### Quality Discussion

### Exploratory Analysis

*Answer the question*: 'Identify the data relevant to the research questions.'

## Data Preparation

### Dataset + Dataset Description

* Show head of each dataset (or some samples, since many are similar)
* How we did our cleaning
* Why we only picked ~50 countries to analyze (we didn't have clean data for everyone)
    ** Why certain countries were more interesting than others (what are the OECD's goals?)

## Modelling
This should include
* Define a descriptive model for the relevant data
* Specify a prior distribution on the parameters
* Use Bayesian inferenc eto re-allocate credibility across parameter values

### Test Design

### Models

### Parameter sections 

### Model Description

### Assessment

## Appendix

### The General Data Cleaning Procedure
